Place the two screenshot files attached to the PR or chat into this folder with the following names so they render in README.md:

- hero.png  → referenced as `public/screenshots/hero.png` (hero/landing view)
- login.png → referenced as `public/screenshots/login.png` (login modal view)

If you prefer different filenames, update the image paths in `README.md` accordingly.
